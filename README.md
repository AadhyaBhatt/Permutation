Try to ﬁnd the plaintext. You need to write programs for computing index of coincidence Ic and mutual index of coincidence MIc. Use the methods discussed in the lecture notes to ﬁnd the key size m ﬁrst, and then ﬁnd out the key. Using the found key you are able to decrypt the ciphertext.

Solution Description:

STEP 1: We printed the key length and the length of the cipher text from the input string. In addition to this, the key length was assumed and added it to the list in the array. 
STEP 2: We calculated the message length of the array.
STEP 3: Created a map of the indecies of coincidence for each given key length.
STEP 4:  Estimate the keys to calculate the  expected Index of coincidence and printed the actual Index of coincidence  0.04309435058333737.
STEP 5: Length of cipher text is calculated.
STEP 6: The value of the text is then round off compare with respect to the actual IC.
STEP 7:We verify that if the length of the text is equal if it is equal to the key.
